**### General note: ###**

Micrium /OS-III is a Real Time Operating System (RTOS) and it has a preemption-based scheduling kernel. This academic project aims to develop a method to change the task management structure and scheduling policy of the OS using splay tree and binomial heap data structures. We implemented EDF Scheduling policy with Stack Resource Policy protocol for resource sharing and synchronization.
